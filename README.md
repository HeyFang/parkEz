You guys can help me complete it, all you need to know are basics of front end, php and mysql.


# Running it locally.

2. clone this repo in xampp/htdocs directory.
3. run xampp, start apace server and mysql db.
4. type localhost in your browser and hit enter.
5. you can visit site by typing path of homepage: parkez/login-register/welcome.html
6. you can open myphp admin for configuring databse:
     a.create a new db named "login_register"
     b.table name "users"
     c.create 4 columns, named "id" (int) with idex as primary, "full_name" (varchar), "email" (varchar), "password"
